# Online-quiz-system
using the Flask framework for creating a quiz system where users can take quizzes on tech-related topics

The user navigates to the homepage and starts the quiz.
The quiz.html template renders questions, and users select their answers.
Upon submission, the server checks the answers, calculates the score, and outputs the score via the result.html template.
The results page shows the score and indicates whether each answer was correct or incorrect.
